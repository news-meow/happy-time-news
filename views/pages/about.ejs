            Chase is a laid back individual with an unappeasable wanderlust. He loves mountains and large bodies of
            water, as well as music in the park and dancing in the rain. He grew up in a small town in northern
            Wisconsin. Software development, he believes, is a stepping stone towards growing within an ever changing
            industry and world.
