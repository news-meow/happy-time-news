            Chase is a laid back individual with an unappeasable wanderlust. He loves mountains and large bodies of
            water, as well as music in the park and dancing in the rain. He grew up in a small town in northern
            Wisconsin. Software development, he believes, is a stepping stone towards growing within an ever changing
            industry and world.

          <p>
            After growing up in a suburb of D.C. Stacey moved to Iowa to pursue her degree
            in psychology at Coe College. After graduating with her B.S., she worked for several years as a sign language
            interpreter. She started feeling stagnant in her career and, after learning about DeltaV through work, found
            herself independently exploring online programming resources. She ultimately took the plunge and joined DeltaV
            with the goal of working in a field that requires continuous problem solving and collaboration with others
            in the pursuit of creating and maintaining technology that impacts the lives of others.
