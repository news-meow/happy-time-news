No covid news portal for finding and saving news articles with a happy, friendly UI.  Utilizing the google news API and a cat memes API, we will deliver a selection of articles that the user can browse and save for future reading.  There will be a page that renderes all of the articles that the user saved into the DB, as well as a simple about us page.  There will be cat memes sprinkled through to create a happy and up beat user experience and environment.  By the end of it, our MVP will be a news portal that allows the user to find a more pleasant experience away from all of the pandemic drama happening around the world, but also a news portal that allows the user to stay up and up with the fast moving times we live in.
