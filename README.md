### Problem Domain

Coronavirus, being a pandemic, is ever present in the news and most all anyone talks about. So with quarantine a world-wide phenomenon and people becoming increasingly restless about it, users need an outlet, access to information that keeps them abreast of current events, but that exists outside of the realm of Covid19. Enter: Our app--keeping people informed, but also providing momentary happiness.

Utilizing the google news API and a cat memes API, we will deliver a selection of articles that the user can browse and save for future reading.  There will be a page that renders all of the articles that the user saved into the DB, as well as a simple about us page.  There will be cat memes sprinkled through to create a happy and up beat user experience and environment.  By the end of it, our MVP will be a news portal that allows the user to find a more pleasant experience away from all of the pandemic drama happening around the world, but also a news portal that allows the user to stay up and up with the fast moving times we live in.
